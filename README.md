# React-Native-Projects

REPOSITORY SUMMARY: After learning about React-Native and the projects/applications that were built off of this language such
Facebook and Instagrams mobile platforms, I became immediately more curious and began building basic applications with it. 
Applications were tested using a basic wrapper program which simulates an iPhone screen on a computer.
